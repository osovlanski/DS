The way I see it we got two options. Option one, we take the easy way out. It's quick and painless. I'm not a fan of option one.
Option two, We fight.

There are a million ways we should've died before today.
And a million ways we can die before tomorrow.
But we fight for every second that we get to spend with each other.
Whether it's two minutes, or two days, we don't give that up. I don't want to give that up.

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
